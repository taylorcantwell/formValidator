# formValidator

Here I complete a basic form with basic HTML, CSS, and JS focusing on DOM manipulation, events, and conditionals. This project was created as part of Brad Traversy's Udemy course called "20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript" and you can see his version of the project here: https://vanillawebprojects.com/projects/form-validator/
