# formValidator
Here I complete a basic form with basic HTML, CSS, and with JS focusing on DOM manipulation, events, and conditionals in JS. This project was created as part of Brad Traversy's Udemy course called "20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript" and you can see his version of the project here: https://vanillawebprojects.com/projects/form-validator/
